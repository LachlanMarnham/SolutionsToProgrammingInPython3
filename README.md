# Solutions to Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language 
# by Mark Summerfield (solutions by Lachlan Marnham)
I like to solve textbook problems for fun. I am providing them for public consumption under the assumption that they will be 
used by people to complement self-study. They are not intended for use by school/university students who were assigned 
problems from the textbook by an instructor. If you are a school/university student who was assigned problems from the 
textbook by an instructor, and have found your way here with a mind to copy my solutions: 1) please don't do that, and 
2) consider asking your instructor to assign their own problems so your peers can't do it either. If you're struggling with a 
exercise, try to think of a specific question the answer to which would solve your problem, and ask it in one of the forums 
I've linked to below.

## Format

Python3Solutions.pdf contains all of the code, with example test runs. These examples are usually chosen to show the full 
behaviour of the code as much as possible (successful run, user enters incorrect input, etc). There are also (sometimes 
lengthy) explainations of what's going on in the code. If Python isn't your first programming language, you can likely skip 
over those. But hopefully someone will find them useful. If you do want to try running my code, copy and pasting from the 
.pdf probably isn't the way to go. You can find all of the solutions in .py form 
[on my GitHub page](https://github.com/LachlanMarnham/SolutionsToProgrammingInPython3).

## Packages

I've made an effort to, given a certain exercise, only use the bits of Python which are covered in the textbook prior to that 
exercise. This leads to some examples of very verbose code which would be made much more elegant with a simple function 
available elsewhere, but I don't think that's in the spirit of the text. If I made a mistake somewhere, and you see a package 
imported somewhere which you don't have installed, you can [install it with pip] (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

## Errata
If you find an error, typo or poor explaination anywhere, please do let me know: 
[lachlan.marnham@gmail.com](lachlan.marnham@gmail.com). There is bound to be at least one bug arising from my absent-mindedly 
writing python 2.x code and checking it with the corresponding interpreter.
